We generate a square wave using a microcontroller. We will be able to see the input code and the outputs being generated by those codes simultaneously.
Code to be used:
 
```assembly
Squarewave: CPL P1.0     # complement the components of port 1.0
            ACALL Delay  # a delay of required time is obtained
            SJMP Squarewave
```

The delay program guides us to a timer which runs for the required amount of time and once the delay program finishes, the pointer gets back and moves to the next statement which guides it to the top of the program and the cycle continues.
